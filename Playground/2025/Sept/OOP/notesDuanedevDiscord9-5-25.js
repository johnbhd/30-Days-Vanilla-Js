/**
 * ðŸ“˜ JavaScript OOP Summary
 * 
 * 1. OOP in JavaScript
 *    - Uses classes, objects, and prototypes.
 *    - Supports encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.
 * 
 * 2. Access Modifiers
 *    - Public: default, accessible everywhere.
 *    - Private (#): only inside the class.
 *    - Protected (_): simulated by naming convention.
 * 
 * 3. Normal vs Static Members
 *    - Normal: belong to object instances, need "new".
 *    - Static: belong to the class, no "new" needed.
 * 
 * 4. Instantiation
 *    - Process of creating an object from a class using "new".
 *    - Class = blueprint, Instance = actual object.
 * 
 * 5. Nested OOP
 *    - Composition: classes containing other classes as properties.
 *    - Static nested classes for scoping.
 *    - Deep nesting is possible but not recommended.
 * 
 * 6. Method Overloading
 *    - No true overloading in JS.
 *    - Simulated with optional params, arguments, or rest (...args).
 * 
 * 7. Constructor Overloading
 *    - Only one constructor allowed per class.
 *    - Simulated by handling different argument cases inside constructor.
